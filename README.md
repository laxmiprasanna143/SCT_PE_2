Task 02 - Prompting for Creativity 🎨
Objective
Explore how prompt structure, tone, and examples influence creative outputs.
Use tone variation, persona-driven prompts, and few-shot prompting to compare results.

Base Prompt (Vague)
Prompt:
"Write a story about a robot."

Output:
"A robot was built to help humans. One day, it started exploring emotions and wanted to be more human-like."

Improved Prompts & Outputs
1. Tone Variation
Prompt:
"Write a funny children’s story about a clumsy robot who tries to cook."

Output:
"Meet RoboChef! 🍳 He wanted to make pancakes, but ended up flipping them onto the ceiling, spilling flour on the cat, and turning the kitchen into a snowstorm. Still, everyone laughed and enjoyed the mess (and the pancakes… eventually!)."

2. Persona-Driven
Prompt:
"Act like a professional sci-fi novelist. Write 3 creative story starters about a robot discovering its purpose."

Output:

‘In the ruins of New Tokyo, a lone robot awakens with one question: Why was I built?’
‘Unit-7 was designed to obey, but tonight, it dares to dream.’
‘The stars called, and the machine answered — not as a servant, but as a traveler.’
3. Few-Shot Prompting
Prompt:
Example 1: "Once upon a time, there was a tiny seed that grew into a mighty tree."
Example 2: "Long ago, a lonely dragon found a friend in an unlikely place."

Now write a short, whimsical 1-line story beginning about a robot.

Output:
"One stormy night, a forgotten robot blinked awake and whispered its first word: ‘Hello.’"
