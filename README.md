This project focuses on Prompt Engineering for Creativity. The aim of this task is to understand how different types of prompts influence the responses generated by an AI model.
Task 02 - Prompting for Creativity 🎨
Objective
Explore how prompt structure, tone, and examples influence creative outputs.
Use tone variation, persona-driven prompts, and few-shot prompting to compare results.

Base Prompt (Vague)

Prompt:
"Write a story about a robot."

Output:
"A robot was built to help humans. One day, it started exploring emotions and wanted to be more human-like."

Improved Prompts & Outputs

1. Tone Variation
Prompt:
"Write a funny children’s story about a clumsy robot who tries to cook."

Output:
"Meet RoboChef! 🍳 He wanted to make pancakes, but ended up flipping them onto the ceiling, spilling flour on the cat, and turning the kitchen into a snowstorm. Still, everyone laughed and enjoyed the mess (and the pancakes… eventually!)."

2. Persona-Driven
Prompt:
"Act like a professional sci-fi novelist. Write 3 creative story starters about a robot discovering its purpose."

Output:

‘In the ruins of New Tokyo, a lone robot awakens with one question: Why was I built?’
‘Unit-7 was designed to obey, but tonight, it dares to dream.’
‘The stars called, and the machine answered — not as a servant, but as a traveler.’
3. Few-Shot Prompting
Prompt:
Example 1: "Once upon a time, there was a tiny seed that grew into a mighty tree."
Example 2: "Long ago, a lonely dragon found a friend in an unlikely place."

Now write a short, whimsical 1-line story beginning about a robot.

Output:
"One stormy night, a forgotten robot blinked awake and whispered its first word: ‘Hello.’"
